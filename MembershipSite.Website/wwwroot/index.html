    <h1>Members website</h1>
    <p>
        This page (index.html) is a placeholder for the publicly accessible section of the website.

        Overwrite this page and and add your own content to this folder to make it publicly accessible.
    </p>
    <h2>Member only area</h2>
    <p>
        For pages or files that only approved members should have access to, upload them to the /secure folder.
        Any attempt to access them will redirect the visitor to a member login page. Once successfully logged in, they will then be redirected to the content they were trying to access.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, trying to access the page at <a href="/secure/index.html">/secure/index.html</a> when not logged in will redirect you to a login page.
